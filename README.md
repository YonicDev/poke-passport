# PokéPassport

**PokéPassport** is a webpage containing information about what Pokémon can be transfered to Generation VIII games of Pokémon and onward, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

**[The website can be seen here](https://yonicdev.github.io/poke-passport/)**.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Once you're ready to test the changes in production, run the following commands:
```bash
npm run build # builds the production-ready website.
npm run start # or npm start. starts the production server.
```

When committing to the main branch of the repository, `npm run export` is automatically called to export the webpage into a deploy-ready website, which will then be deployed to Github Pages, so work on the repository should be handled via forks and branches, and the resulting changes will later be merged in the main branch.
